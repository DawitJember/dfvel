Description: The aim of the dfvel package is to simplify computation of child growth velocity
   in epidemiological studies. The package compute height, weight, and 
   head circumference velocity from long form data using the numeric and LMS methods. 
   The package uses the 2009 WHO growth velocity standard to compute individual growth 
   velocity z score.
